 VivaAI 
Your AI interview buddy — practice smarter, not harder.

VivaAI is an AI-powered interview preparation platform that helps you practice interviews like they actually happen — with role-based questions, timed practice, and feedback that tells you exactly what to fix.

I built VivaAI because most interview prep feels messy:
you find random questions online, practice a little, but never really know *where you stand*.

VivaAI makes interview prep structured, realistic, and confidence-building.

✅ Lets you answer like a real mock interview (text / optional voice later)
